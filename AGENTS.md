# tula-closeline-auth

Closeline auth service: sign-in, sessions and tokens, copied from tula-auth

Kind: **service**. Common standards for every Closeline repo are in `.claude/COMMON.md`, synced
from the hub (`tula-closeline`). This file holds only what is specific to this repo. Keep it under
200 lines: put detail in a path-scoped rule under `.claude/rules/` or a decision record in the hub.

## Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `bun install` | install, including the tagged `tula-closeline-*` libraries |
| `bun run verify` | the full gate, exactly what CI runs |
| `bun run verify:changed` | the quick gate the Stop hook runs |
| `bun test` | tests |
| `bun run bench` | the benchmarks and their budgets |
| `bun run openapi` | rewrite `openapi.json` after a route or schema change |

Other scripts are in `package.json`.

## Layout

The shape in `.claude/COMMON.md` is built; add modules under `src/modules/<name>/`.

- `src/container.ts` is the only composition root: env, kit logger, clock, readiness checks,
  `lifecycle`, and `reportError`. `src/testing.ts` builds the same container from in-memory doubles.
- `reportError(error, context)` is the one seam for unexpected errors (5xx only). It logs through
  the kit today; the error tracker is wired in there and nowhere else. It must not throw. Call
  `reportSafely`, never it directly.
- `src/http/` is the middleware stack in `createBaseApp`: request id, error guard, body limit,
  error handler, 404. Modules build routes with `createRouter()` and `errorResponse(...)` so every
  route is described for OpenAPI and failures take the contract's `area.reason` codes.
- Readiness: add a `ReadinessCheck` to `readinessChecks` when a dependency arrives. `/readyz` runs
  them concurrently, each with `READINESS_TIMEOUT_MS`, and never returns the failure reason.
  `/healthz` checks nothing.
- Shutdown (`src/shutdown.ts`): on SIGTERM `/readyz` goes 503, `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS` passes, the
  server stops accepting, `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` bounds the drain, then it exits. A second signal
  over a second later exits at once.
- Log errors with `describeError`, never the raw error.
- `openapi.json` is generated: `bun run openapi`; `verify` fails if it is stale. No database yet:
  add `tula-closeline-db` when the first table is needed.

## Env keys (`src/env.ts`, mirrored in `.env.example`)

`ENVIRONMENT` (required, no default), `PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `READINESS_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS`, `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS`, `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`. Add a key in both files.

## Hot paths

The per-request middleware stack (`createBaseApp`) and `/healthz`. Budgets are in `bench/`.

A benchmark times `measure(operation)`: a warm-up, then several batches, gated on the fastest, so a
noisy runner cannot fail it but a real regression (every batch slower) does. Budget is about 5x the
typical best batch, written in the file. `bun run bench` is part of `verify`. Add a benchmark and
name the function here when a new hot path appears.

## Issues

All tickets live in the hub: `gh issue list -R Tula-Solutions/tula-closeline --label repo:auth`.
